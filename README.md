The purpose of this assignment was to create a small webpage utilizing the MVC model. The site has 4 pages that are dynamically loaded using jquery. Each page's content is stored in the model and is loaded when the event listeners in the controller are activated. The site was designed by my girlfriend and programmed by me.
